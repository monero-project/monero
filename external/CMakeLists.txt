# This is broken up into two parts: first we check for miniupnp, compile it if we can't
# find it, and thereafter we check for libunbound, and compile it if we can't find it.
# We always compile if we are building statically to reduce static dependency issues...
# ...except for FreeBSD, because FreeBSD is a special case that doesn't play well with
# others.
