.SH NAME
monerod \- Monero p2p network daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B monerod
[\fI\,options|settings\/\fR] [\fI\,daemon_command...\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
The Monero daemon \fBmonerod\fR keeps your computer synchronized with the Monero blockchain by downloading and validating the blockchain from the p2p network.

\fBmonerod\fR is entirely decoupled from your wallet.

\fBmonerod\fR is mainly used by your wallet software over local RPC connection, as in \fBMonero GUI\fR.

\fBmonerod\fR does not access your private keys \- it is not aware of your transactions and balance, so you can run \fBmonerod\fR on a separate computer or in the cloud. In fact, you can connect to a remote \fBmonerod\fR instance provided by a semi-trusted 3rd party, who will not be able to steal your funds; this third-party configuration is very handy for learning and experimentation.

However, there are privacy and reliability implications to using a remote, untrusted node. For any real business you should be running your own full node.

\fBmonerod\fR can save you time syncing the whole blockchain by relaying your wallet requests over p2p network nodes 
.br
by using \fB--bootstrap-daemon-address\fR see \fBmonerod Performance\fR section for more info.


.SH Options:
Arguments in parentheses are default
.br
.TP

OS for which this executable was compiled.
.TP
\fB\--check-updates\fR arg (=notify)
Check for new versions of monero: [disabled|notify|download|update]


.SS Pick Monero network (blockchain):
.TP
By default \fBmonerod\fR runs on --mainnet
.TP
\fB\--testnet\fR
Run on testnet. The wallet must be launched with --testnet flag.
.TP
\fB\--stagenet\fR
Run on stagenet. The wallet must be launched with --stagenet flag.


.SS Server Config:
.TP
\fB\--config-file\fR arg
.br
(=~/.bitmonero/bitmonero.conf, 
.br
~/.bitmonero/testnet/bitmonero.conf if 'testnet', 
.br
~/.bitmonero/stagenet/bitmonero.conf if 'stagenet')
.br
Specify full path to configuration file, By default \fBmonerod\fR looks for bitmonero.conf in Monero data directory.
.TP
\fB\--data-dir\fR arg
(=~/.bitmonero,
.br
~/.bitmonero/testnet if 'testnet',
.br
~/.bitmonero/stagenet if 'stagenet')
.br
Specify full path for data directory, This is where the blockchain, log files, and p2p network memory are stored. 
.TP
\fB\--pidfile\fR arg                         
File path to write the daemon's PID to (optional, requires \--detach)
.TP
\fB\--detach\fR
Run as daemon
.TP
\fB\--non-interactive\fR                     
Run non-interactive, Do not require tty in a foreground mode. Helpful when running in a container. By default \fBmonerod\fR runs in a foreground and opens stdin for reading.
.TP
\fB\--max-txpool-weight\fR arg (=648000000)
Set maximum txpool weight in bytes. These are transactions pending for confirmations (not included in any block).
.TP
\fB\--enforce-dns-checkpointing\fR
checkpoints from DNS server will be enforced, The emergency checkpoints set by \fBMoneroPulse\fR operators will be enforced. It is probably a good idea to set enforcing for unattended nodes.
If encountered block hash does not match corresponding checkpoint, the local blockchain will be rolled back a few blocks, effectively blocking following what MoneroPulse operators consider invalid fork. The log entry will be produced: \fBERROR Local blockchain failed to pass a checkpoint, rolling back!\fR Eventually, the alternative (“fixed”) fork will get heavier and the node will follow it, leaving the “invalid” fork behind.
.TP
\fB\--disable-dns-checkpoints\fR
Do not retrieve checkpoints from DNS
.TP
\fB\--ban-list\fR arg
Specify ban list file, one IP address per line

Dynamically restrict the number of spans in queue by estimating how many spans can be synced within N minutes. The dynamic minimum is 10 spans, and is further capped by block-download-max-size.
.TP
\fB\--no-sync\fR                   
Don't synchronize the blockchain with other peers, intended to be used with \fB\--bootstrap-daemon-address\fR allowing reliance on other public P2P nodes for blockchain data.

When a monerod process is in \fB\--no-sync\fR mode, virtually all data requests are forwarded to the bootstrap node, as the local node does not have synchronized block data.

This flag is enabled in Simple GUI Mode.

.SH Other Daemon RPC Calls

Not all daemon RPC calls use the JSON_RPC interface. This section gives examples of these calls.

The data structure for these calls is different than the JSON RPC calls. Whereas the JSON RPC methods were called using the \fB/json_rpc\fR extension and specifying a method, these methods are called at their own extensions. For example:

.nf
.RS 4
    IP=127.0.0.1
    PORT=18081
    METHOD='gettransactions'
    PARAMS='{"txs_hashes":["d6e48158472848e6687173a91ae6eebfa3e1d778e65252ee99d7515d63090408"]}'
    curl \
		http://$IP:$PORT/$METHOD \
		-d $PARAMS \
		-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
.RE
.fi

Note: It is recommended to use JSON RPC where such alternatives exist, rather than the following methods. For example, the recommended way to get a node's height is via the JSON RPC methods get_info or get_last_block_header, rather than getheight below.

For calls that end with \fB.bin\fR, the data is exchanged in the form of binary, serialized objects, as defined in the Core RPC Server.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Change Log file:
Full path to the log file. Example (mind file permissions):

.B ./monerod --log-file=/var/log/monero/mainnet/monerod.log

.SS Change PID:
Full path to the PID file. Works only with --detach.

.B ./monerod --detach --pidfile=/run/monero/monerod.pid

.SS Pick Blockchain:

You can run \fBmonerod\fR in two modes,
.sp 2 
stagenet for learning and experimentation.

\fB\./monerod \--stagenet \--detach\fR        # run as a daemon in background
.br
\fBtail \-f ~/.bitmonero/stagenet/bitmonero.log\fR  # watch the logs
.br
\fB\./monerod \--stagenet exit\fR           # ask daemon to exit gracefully

mainnet is when you want to deal with the real XMR.

\fB\./monerod \--detach\fR        # run as a daemon in background
.br
\fBtail \-f ~/.bitmonero/bitmonero.log\fR  # watch the logs
.br
\fB\./monerod exit\fR           # ask daemon to exit gracefully


.SS P2p network protocol over Tor via torsocks:
.B DNS_PUBLIC=tcp://1.1.1.1 TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1 torsocks ./monerod --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1  --no-igd  --hide-my-port


.SS P2p custom bind port:
TCP port to listen for p2p network connections. Defaults to 18080 for mainnet, 28080 for testnet, and 38080 for stagenet. You normally wouldn’t change that. This is helpful to run several nodes on your machine to simulate private Monero p2p network (likely using private Testnet).

.B ./monerod --p2p-bind-port=48080

.SS Adding multiple nodes:
Specify list of nodes to connect to and then attempt to keep the connection open.

.B ./monerod --add-priority-node=178.128.192.138:18081 --add-priority-node=144.76.202.167:18081

Specify list of nodes to connect to only. Options --add-priority-node and --seed-node are ignored when using \fB--add-exclusive-node\fR.

.B ./monerod --add-exclusive-node=178.128.192.138:18081 --add-exclusive-node=144.76.202.167:18081


.SS Transactions over proxy:
Send out your local transactions through SOCKS5 proxy (Tor or I2P). Format:
.B <network-type>,<socks-ip:port>[,max_connections][,disable_noise]

.B ./monerod --tx-proxy "tx-proxy=tor,127.0.0.1:9050,16"

.SS Route incoming connections through your onionized P2P interface:
Allow anonymous incoming connections to your onionized P2P interface. Format:
.B <hidden-service-address>,<[bind-ip:]port>[,max_connections]

.B ./monerod --anonymous-inbound "rveahdfho7wo4b2m.onion:18083,127.0.0.1:18083,100"

.SS Proxy all connections:
Network communication through proxy. Works with any service that supports SOCKS4, including Tor, i2p, and commercial VPN/proxy services. SOCKS5 support is anticipated in the future. Enabling this setting sends all traffic through this proxy. Can be used in conjunction with --tx-proxy, in which case transaction broadcasts originating from the connected wallet(s) will be sent through Tor or i2p as specified in --tx-proxy, and all other traffic will be sent through the SOCKS proxy. Format:
.B <socks-ip:port>

.B ./monerod --proxy "proxy=127.0.0.1:1080"

.SS Blocks notify:
Run a program for each new block. The <arg> must be a full path. If the <arg> contains %s it will be replaced by the block hash. Example:

.B ./monerod --block-notify="/usr/bin/echo %s"

Block notifications are good for immediate reaction. However, you should always assume you will miss some block notifications and you should independently poll the API to cover this up.

Mind blockchain reorganizations. Block notifications can revert to same and past heights. Small reorganizations are natural and happen every day.


.SS Change blocks sync size:
How many blocks are processed in a single batch during chain synchronization. By default this is 20 blocks for newer history and 100 blocks for older history (“pre v4”). Default behavior is represented by value 0. Intuitively, the more resources you have, the bigger batch size you may want to try out.

.B ./monerod --block-sync-size=500

.SS Bootstrap:
The host:port of a “bootstrap” remote open node that the connected wallets can use while this node is still not fully synced. Example:

.B ./monerod --bootstrap-daemon-address=opennode.xmr-tw.org:18089 

The node will forward selected RPC calls to the bootstrap node. The wallet will handle this automatically and transparently. Obviously, such bootstraping phase has privacy implications similar to directly using a remote node.

.SS Baning IPs:
Specify ban list file, one IP address per line. This was introduced as an emergency measure to deal with large DDoS attacks on Monero p2p network in Dec 2020 / Jan 2021.

.B ./monerod --ban-list=block.txt

It is not recommended to statically ban any IP addresses unless you absolutely need to. Banning IPs often excludes the most vulnerable users who are forced to operate entirely behind Tor or other anonymity networks.
