Introduction
------------

Monero is a private, secure, untraceable currency. You are your bank, you control your
funds, and nobody can trace your transfers.

Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive
funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of
transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all
transfers remain absolutely private by default.

Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every
transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 24 word
mnemonic that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet
files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain
types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only
untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions
cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

About this Project
------------------

This is the core implementation of Monero. It is open source and completely free to use
without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are
no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Monero that uses the
protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the
"staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that master repo,
they are tested by individual developers, as well as contributors who focus on thorough
testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully
considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the 
repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally
a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

Anyone is able to contribute to Monero. If you have a fix or code change, feel free to
submit is as a pull request. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not
affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the
collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it
is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull
request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

Compiling Monero
----------------

On Unix and Linux:

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.53 or later (except
1.54, more details here: http://goo.gl/RrCFmA).
Build using user-local compiler and boost is supported, see src/doc/build-help.txt

- To build full project (not for developers) change to the root of the source code directory, 
and run 'make all-release'
- The resulting executables can be found in build/release/src.

- To build developer's version (faster, skips some modules etc) run 'make fast'
- The resulting executables can be found in build/fast/src.

- The command 'make' defaults now to work as 'make fast'

Advanced options:

- Parallel build: append -j<number of threads> to the make, like this: make -j 4 fast

- Debug build: run 'make build-debug'.

- Test suite: run 'make test-release' to run tests in addition to building. Running
  'make test-debug' will do the same to the debug version.

- Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not
  work everywhere. To build, run 'export CC=clang CXX=clang++' before running 'make'.

On OS X:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Unix and Linux above.

Alternatively, it can be built in an easier and more automated fashion using Homebrew:

- Ensure Homebrew is installed, it can be found at http://brew.sh

- Add the repository: brew tap sammy007/cryptonight

- Build wallet: brew install --HEAD bitmonero

On Windows:
Dependencies: MSVC 2012 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.53 or later. You may download them from:
http://www.microsoft.com/
http://www.cmake.org/
http://www.boost.org/

We are in the process of dropping support for MSVC in favor of the MSYS2
environment, which includes an up-to-date MinGW-w64 toolchain (based on the gcc
compiler).  You will either be provided with or need to install all necessary
build dependencies (e.g., cmake, git) inside the MSYS2 environment, so it will
not help you to install these tools separately.

This build is still experimental, so things may not work for you.  If you're
having issues, please let us know.  My current test VM is 64-bit Windows 7 and
I cannot afford multiple Windows licenses, so there may be problems with other
configurations that I'm not yet aware of.

- Download the MSYS2 installer from SourceForge and run it.

- Use the shortcut associated with your architecture to launch the MSYS2
  environment.  On my system, I run the MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell shortcut.  Note
  that if you are running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit
  environments.

- Update the packages in your MSYS2 install:

    pacman -Sy
    pacman -Su --ignoregroup base
    pacman -Su

  For those of you already familiar with pacman, you can run the normal `pacman
  -Syu` to update, but you may get errors and need to restart MSYS2 if pacman's
  dependencies are updated.

- Clone the repo:

    git clone http://github.com/monero/bitmonero.git

- On 64-bit:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
          mingw-w64-x86_64-boost
    mkdir bitmonero/build
    cd bitmonero/build
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
          -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../msys2/64-bit-toolchain.cmake \
          -D MSYS2_FOLDER=c:/msys64 ..
    make

- On 32-bit:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc make mingw-w64-i686-cmake \
          mingw-w64-i686-boost
    mkdir bitmonero/build
    cd bitmonero/build
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
          -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../msys2/32-bit-toolchain.cmake \
          -D MSYS2_FOLDER=c:/msys64 ..
    make

If you installed MSYS2 in a folder other than c:/msys64, make the appropriate substitution above.

----------------------
Building Documentation
----------------------

Monero developer documentation uses Doxygen, and is currently a work-in-progress.

Dependencies: Doxygen 1.8.0 or later, Graphviz 2.28 or later (optional)

- To build, change to the root of the source code directory, and run 'doxygen Doxyfile'

- If you have installed Graphviz, you can also generate in-doc diagrams by instead running
  'HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile'

- The output will be built in doc/html/
