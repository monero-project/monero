Subject: [PATCH] Fix build on arm64 architectures with some strict compilers

This patch fixes an issue that occurs on 64-bit architetures under
strict compiler rules. The code initially checked that the received
size stored in 'uint64_t' was not bigger than the max value of a
'size_t' variable, which is legitimate on 32-bit architectures where
'size_t' variables are stored on 32 bits. On 64-bit architectures,
this test no longer makes sense since 'uint64_t' and 'size_t' types
have the same size. The issue is fixed by ignoring this portion
of code when built for arm64.
