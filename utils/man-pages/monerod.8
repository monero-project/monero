.SH NAME
.PP
monerod - connect to Monero\[cq]s blockchain.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[V]./monerod [options] [command]\f[R]
.PP
Options define how the daemon should be working.
Their names follow the \f[V]--option-name\f[R] pattern.
.PP
Commands give access to specific services provided by the daemon.
Commands are executed against the running daemon.
Their names follow the \f[V]command_name\f[R] pattern.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Connects you to Monero network
.PP
The Monero daemon \f[V]monerod\f[R] keeps your computer synced up with
the Monero network.
.PP
It downloads and validates the blockchain from the p2p network.
.SS Not aware of your private keys
.PP
\f[V]monerod\f[R] is entirely decoupled from your wallet.
.PP
\f[V]monerod\f[R] does not access your private keys - it is not aware of
your transactions and balance.
.PP
This allows you to run \f[V]monerod\f[R] on a separate computer or in
the cloud.
.PP
In fact, you can connect to a remote \f[V]monerod\f[R] instance provided
by a semi-trusted 3rd party.
Such 3rd party will not be able to steal your funds.
This is very handy for learning and experimentation.
.PP
However, there are privacy and reliability implications to using a
remote, untrusted node.
For any real business \f[B]you should be running your own full
node\f[R].
.SS Running
.PP
Go to directory where you unpacked Monero.
.PP
The stagenet is what you should be using for learning and
experimentation.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&./monerod --stagenet --detach                # run as a daemon in background
tail -f \[ti]/.bitmonero/stagenet/bitmonero.log  # watch the logs
\&./monerod --stagenet exit                    # ask daemon to exit gracefully
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The mainnnet is when you want to deal with the real XMR.

\f[C]
\&./monerod --detach                           # run as a daemon in background

\f[R]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Options define how the daemon should be working.
Their names follow the \f[V]--option-name\f[R] pattern.
.PP
The following groups are only to make reference easier to follow.
The daemon itself does not group options in any way.

T}
T{
\f[V]--log-level\f[R]
T}@T{
\f[V]0-4\f[R] with \f[V]0\f[R] being minimal logging and \f[V]4\f[R]
being full tracing.
Defaults to \f[V]0\f[R].
These are general presets and do not directly map to severity levels.
For example, even with minimal \f[V]0\f[R], you may see some most
important \f[V]INFO\f[R] entries.
Temporarily changing to \f[V]1\f[R] allows for much better understanding
of how the full node operates.
Example:
T}
T{
T}@T{
\f[V]./monerod --log-level=1\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]--max-log-file-size\f[R]
T}@T{
Soft limit in bytes for the log file (=104850000 by default, which is
just under 100MB).
Once log file grows past that limit, \f[V]monerod\f[R] creates the next
log file with a UTC timestamp postfix \f[V]-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS\f[R].
T}
T{
T}@T{
In production deployments, you would probably prefer to use established
solutions like logrotate instead.
In that case, set \f[V]--max-log-file-size=0\f[R] to prevent monerod
from managing the log files.
T}
T{
\f[V]--max-log-files\f[R]

T{
\f[V]--config-file\f[R]

Full path to the configuration file.
By default \f[V]monerod\f[R] looks for \f[V]bitmonero.conf\f[R] in
Monero data directory.
T}
T{
\f[V]--data-dir\f[R]
T}@T{
Full path to data directory.
This is where the blockchain, log files, and p2p network memory are
stored.
For defaults and details see data directory.
T}
T{
\f[V]--pidfile\f[R]
T}@T{
Full path to the PID file.
Works only with \f[V]--detach\f[R].
Example:

T}@T{
\f[V]./monerod --detach --pidfile=/run/monero/monerod.pid\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]--detach\f[R]
T}@T{
Go to background (decouple from the terminal).
This is useful for long-running / server scenarios.
Typically, you will also want to manage \f[V]monerod\f[R] daemon with
systemd or similar.
By default \f[V]monerod\f[R] runs in a foreground.
T}
T{
\f[V]--non-interactive\f[R]
T}@T{
Do not require tty in a foreground mode.
Helpful when running in a container.
By default \f[V]monerod\f[R] runs in a foreground and opens stdin for
reading.
This breaks containerization because no tty gets assigned and
\f[V]monerod\f[R] process crashes.
You can make it run in a background with \f[V]--detach\f[R] but this is
inconvenient in a containerized environment because the canonical usage
is that the container waits on the main process to exist (forking makes
things more complicated).
T}
T{
\f[V]--no-zmq\f[R]
T}@T{
Disable ZMQ RPC server.
You \f[B]should\f[R] use this option to limit attack surface and number
of unnecessarily open ports (the ZMQ server is unfinished thing and you
are unlikely to ever use it).
T}
T{
\f[V]--no-igd\f[R]
T}@T{
Disable UPnP port mapping on the router (\[lq]Internet Gateway
Device\[rq]).
Add this option to improve security if you are \f[B]not\f[R] behind a
NAT (you can bind directly to public IP or you run through Tor).
T}
T{
\f[V]--max-txpool-weight\f[R]
T}@T{
Set maximum transactions pool size in bytes.
By default 648000000 (\[ti]618MB).
These are transactions pending for confirmations (not included in any
block).
T}
T{
\f[V]--enforce-dns-checkpointing\f[R]

The emergency checkpoints set by MoneroPulse operators will be enforced.
It is probably a good idea to set enforcing for unattended nodes.

T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-bind-port\f[R]
T}@T{
TCP port to listen for p2p network connections.
Defaults to \f[V]18080\f[R] for mainnet, \f[V]28080\f[R] for testnet,
and \f[V]38080\f[R] for stagenet.
You normally wouldn\[cq]t change that.
This is helpful to run several nodes on your machine to simulate private
Monero p2p network (likely using private Testnet).
Example:
T}
T{
T}@T{
\f[V]./monerod --p2p-bind-port=48080\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-external-port\f[R]
T}@T{
TCP port to listen for p2p network connections on your router.
Relevant if you are behind a NAT and still want to accept incoming
connections.
You must then set this to relevant port on your router.
This is to let \f[V]monerod\f[R] know what to advertise on the network.
Default is \f[V]0\f[R].
T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-use-ipv6\f[R]
T}@T{
Enable IPv6 for p2p (disabled by default).
T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-bind-ipv6-address\f[R]
T}@T{
IPv6 network interface to bind to for p2p network protocol.
Default value \f[V]::\f[R] binds to all network interfaces.
T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-bind-port-ipv6\f[R]
T}@T{
TCP port to listen for p2p network connections.
By default same as IPv4 port for given nettype.
T}
T{
\f[V]--p2p-ignore-ipv4\f[R]
T}@T{
Ignore unsuccessful IPv4 bind for p2p.
Useful if you only want to use IPv6.
T}
T{
\f[V]--igd\f[R]
T}@T{
Set UPnP port mapping on the router (\[lq]Internet Gateway Device\[rq]).
One of: \f[V]disabled\f[R] | \f[V]enabled\f[R] | \f[V]delayed\f[R]
(=\f[V]delayed\f[R] by default).
Relevant if you are behind NAT and want to accept incoming P2P network
connections.
The \f[V]delayed\f[R] value means it will wait for incoming connections
in hope UPnP may not be necessary.
After a while w/o incoming connections found it will attempt to map
ports with UPnP.
If you know you need UPnP change it to \f[V]enabled\f[R] to fast track
the process.
T}
T{
\f[V]--hide-my-port\f[R]
T}@T{
\f[V]monerod\f[R] will still open and listen on the p2p port.
However, it will not announce itself as a peer list candidate.
Technically, it will return port \f[V]0\f[R] in a response to p2p
handshake (\f[V]node_data.my_port = 0\f[R] in
\f[V]get_local_node_data\f[R] function).
In effect nodes you connect to won\[cq]t spread your IP to other nodes.
To sum up, it is not really hiding, it is more like \[lq]do not
advertise\[rq].
T}
T{
\f[V]--seed-node\f[R]
T}@T{
Connect to a node to retrieve other nodes\[cq] addresses, and
disconnect.
If not specified, \f[V]monerod\f[R] will use hardcoded seed nodes on the
first run, and peers cached on disk on subsequent runs.
T}
T{
\f[V]--add-peer\f[R]

\f[V]--limit-rate\f[R]
T}@T{
Set the same limit value for incoming and outgoing data transfer.
By default (\f[V]-1\f[R]) the individual up/down default limits will be

It is better to use \f[V]--limit-rate-up\f[R] and
\f[V]--limit-rate-down\f[R] instead to avoid confusion.

Max number of threads to use when computing block hashes (PoW) in

when syncing.
T}
T{
\f[V]--fast-block-sync\f[R]
T}@T{
Sync up most of the way by using embedded, \[lq]known\[rq] block hashes.
Pass \f[V]1\f[R] to turn on and \f[V]0\f[R] to turn off.
This is on (\f[V]1\f[R]) by default.
Normally, for every block the full node must calculate the block hash to
verify miner\[cq]s proof of work.
Because the CryptoNight PoW used in Monero is very expensive (even for
verification), \f[V]monerod\f[R] offers skipping these calculations for
old blocks.
In other words, it\[cq]s a mechanism to trust \f[V]monerod\f[R] binary

How many blocks are processed in a single batch during chain

By default this is 20 blocks for newer history and 100 blocks for older
history (\[lq]pre v4\[rq]).
Default behavior is represented by value \f[V]0\f[R].
Intuitively, the more resources you have, the bigger batch size you may
want to try out.

Example:
T}
T{
T}@T{
\f[V]./monerod --bootstrap-daemon-address=opennode.xmr-tw.org:18089\f[R].
The node will forward selected RPC calls to the bootstrap node.
The wallet will handle this automatically and transparently.
Obviously, such bootstraping phase has privacy implications similar to
directly using a remote node.
T}

\f[V]--bootstrap-daemon-login\f[R]
