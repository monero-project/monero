/**
 * @brief Container for safely constructing Blockchain and tx_memory_pool classes
 * 
 * The reason for this class existing is that the constructors for both Blockchain and
 * tx_memory_pool take a reference for tx_memory_pool and Blockchain, respectively. Because of this
 * circular reference, it is annoying/unsafe to construct these normally. This class guarantees that
 * we don't make any silly mistakes with pointers / dangling references.
