 * Fast, portable, and easy-to-use Twofish implementation,
 * Version 0.3.
 * Copyright (c) 2002 by Niels Ferguson.
 * (See further down for the almost-unrestricted licensing terms.)
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There are two files for this implementation:
 * - twofish.h, the header file.
 * - twofish.c, the code file.
 *
 * To incorporate this code into your program you should:
 * - Check the licensing terms further down in this comment.
 * - Fix the two type definitions in twofish.h to suit your platform.
 * - Fix a few definitions in twofish.c in the section marked
 *   PLATFORM FIXES. There is one important ones that affects
 *   functionality, and then a few definitions that you can optimise
 *   for efficiency but those have no effect on the functionality.
 *   Don't change anything else.
 * - Put the code in your project and compile it.
 *
 * To use this library you should:
 * - Use Twofish_prepare_key(...) to convert a key to internal form.
 * - Use Twofish_encrypt_block(...) and Twofish_decrypt_block(...) to encrypt and decrypt
 *   data.
 * See the comments in the header file for details on these functions.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * There are many Twofish implementation available for free on the web.
 * Most of them are hard to integrate into your own program.
 * As we like people to use our cipher, I thought I would make it easier.
 * Here is a free and easy-to-integrate Twofish implementation in C.
 * The latest version is always available from my personal home page at
 *    http://niels.ferguson.net/
 *
 * Integrating library code into a project is difficult because the library
 * header files interfere with the project's header files and code.
 * And of course the project's header files interfere with the library code.
 * I've tried to resolve these problems here.
 * The header file of this implementation is very light-weight.
 * It contains two typedefs, a structure, and a few function declarations.
 * All names it defines start with "Twofish_".
 * The header file is therefore unlikely to cause problems in your project.
 * The code file of this implementation doesn't need to include the header
 * files of the project. There is thus no danger of the project interfering
 * with all the definitions and macros of the Twofish code.
 * In most situations, all you need to do is fill in a few platform-specific
 * definitions in the header file and code file,
 * and you should be able to run the Twofish code in your project.
 * I estimate it should take you less than an hour to integrate this code
 * into your project, most of it spent reading the comments telling you what
 * to do.
 *
 * For people using C++: it is very easy to wrap this library into a
 * TwofishKey class. One of the big advantages is that you can automate the
 * wiping of the key material in the destructor. I have not provided a C++
 * class because the interface depends too much on the abstract base class
 * you use for block ciphers in your program, which I don't know about.
 *
 * This implementation is designed for use on PC-class machines. It uses the
 * Twofish 'full' keying option which uses large tables. Total table size is
 * around 5-6 kB for static tables plus 4.5 kB for each pre-processed key.
 * If you need an implementation that uses less memory,
 * take a look at Brian Gladman's code on his web site:
 *     http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptography_technology/aes/
 * He has code for all AES candidates.
 * His Twofish code has lots of options trading off table size vs. speed.
 * You can also take a look at the optimised code by Doug Whiting on the
 * Twofish web site
 *      http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html
 * which has loads of options.
 * I believe these existing implementations are harder to re-use because they
 * are not clean libraries and they impose requirements on the environment.
 * This implementation is very careful to minimise those,
 * and should be easier to integrate into any larger program.
 *
 * The default mode of this implementation is fully portable as it uses no
 * behaviour not defined in the C standard. (This is harder than you think.)
 * If you have any problems porting the default mode, please let me know
 * so that I can fix the problem. (But only if this code is at fault, I
 * don't fix compilers.)
 * Most of the platform fixes are related to non-portable but faster ways
 * of implementing certain functions.
 *
 * In general I've tried to make the code as fast as possible, at the expense
 * of memory and code size. However, C does impose limits, and this
 * implementation will be slower than an optimised assembler implementation.
 * But beware of assembler implementations: a good Pentium implementation
 * uses completely different code than a good Pentium II implementation.
 * You basically have to re-write the assembly code for every generation of
 * processor. Unless you are severely pressed for speed, stick with C.
 *
 * The initialisation routine of this implementation contains a self-test.
 * If initialisation succeeds without calling the fatal routine, then
 * the implementation works. I don't think you can break the implementation
 * in such a way that it still passes the tests, unless you are malicious.
 * In other words: if the initialisation routine returns,
 * you have successfully ported the implementation.
 * (Or not implemented the fatal routine properly, but that is your problem.)
 *
 * I'm indebted to many people who helped me in one way or another to write
 * this code. During the design of Twofish and the AES process I had very
 * extensive discussions of all implementation issues with various people.
 * Doug Whiting in particular provided a wealth of information. The Twofish
 * team spent untold hours discussion various cipher features, and their
 * implementation. Brian Gladman implemented all AES candidates in C,
 * and we had some fruitful discussions on how to implement Twofish in C.
 * Jan Nieuwenhuizen tested this code on Linux using GCC.

 * Version 0.1, 2002-09-03
 *      Added disclaimer. Improved self-tests.
 * Version 0.2, 2002-09-09
 *      Removed last non-portabilities. Default now works completely within

 * Version 0.3, 2002-09-28
 *      Bugfix: use <string.h> instead of <memory.h> to adhere to ANSI/ISO.
 *      Rename BIG_ENDIAN macro to CPU_IS_BIG_ENDIAN. The gcc library
 *      header <string.h> already defines BIG_ENDIAN, even though it is not

 * PLATFORM FIXES
 * ==============
 *
 * Fix the type definitions in twofish.h first!

 * The following definitions have to be fixed for each particular platform

 * portable definitions that you can substitute here without changing the
 * rest of the code.
 */


/*
 * Function called if something is fatally wrong with the implementation.
 * This fatal function is called when a coding error is detected in the
 * Twofish implementation, or when somebody passes an obviously erroneous
 * parameter to this implementation. There is not much you can do when
 * the code contains bugs, so we just stop.
 *
 * The argument is a string. Ideally the fatal function prints this string
 * as an error message. Whatever else this function does, it should never
 * return. A typical implementation would stop the program completely after
 * printing the error message.
 *
 * This default implementation is not very useful,
 * but does not assume anything about your environment.
 * It will at least let you know something is wrong....
 * I didn't want to include any libraries to print and error or so,
 * as this makes the code much harder to integrate in a project.
 *
 * Note that the Twofish_fatal function may not return to the caller.
 * Unfortunately this is not something the self-test can test for,
 * so you have to make sure of this yourself.
 *
 * If you want to call an external function, be careful about including
 * your own header files here. This code uses a lot of macros, and your
 * header file could easily break it. Maybe the best solution is to use
 * a separate extern statement for your fatal function.

 * of this Twofish implementation. That is, their default settings

 * will result in erroneous implementations, but the self-test should
 * catch those.

/*
 * Macros to rotate a Twofish_UInt32 value left or right by the
 * specified number of bits. This should be a 32-bit rotation,
 * and not rotation of, say, 64-bit values.
 *
 * Every encryption or decryption operation uses 32 of these rotations,
 * so it is a good idea to make these macros efficient.
 *
 * This fully portable definition has one piece of tricky stuff.
 * The UInt32 might be larger than 32 bits, so we have to mask
 * any higher bits off. The simplest way to do this is to 'and' the
 * value first with 0xffffffff and then shift it right. An optimising
 * compiler that has a 32-bit type can optimise this 'and' away.
 *
 * Unfortunately there is no portable way of writing the constant
 * 0xffffffff. You don't know which suffix to use (U, or UL?)
 * The UINT32_MASK definition uses a bit of trickery. Shift-left
 * is only defined if the shift amount is strictly less than the size
 * of the UInt32, so we can't use (1<<32). The answer it to take the value
 * 2, cast it to a UInt32, shift it left 31 positions, and subtract one.
 * Another example of how to make something very simple extremely difficult.
 * I hate C.
 *
 * The rotation macros are straightforward.
 * They are only applied to UInt32 values, which are _unsigned_
 * so the >> operator must do a logical shift that brings in zeroes.
 * On most platforms you will only need to optimise the ROL32 macro; the
 * ROR32 macro is not inefficient on an optimising compiler as all rotation
 * amounts in this code are known at compile time.
 *
 * On many platforms there is a faster solution.
 * For example, MS compilers have the __rotl and __rotr functions
 * that generate x86 rotation instructions.

 *
 * Twofish operates on 32-bit words. The input to the cipher is
 * a byte array, as is the output. The portable method of doing the
 * conversion is a bunch of rotate and mask operations, but on many
 * platforms it can be done faster using a cast.

 *
 * Set to 0 to use the shift and mask operations. This is fully

 *
 * Set to 1 to use a cast. The Byte * is cast to a UInt32 *, and a
 * UInt32 is read. If necessary (as indicated by the CPU_IS_BIG_ENDIAN
 * macro) the byte order in the UInt32 is swapped. The reverse is done
 * to write the output of the encryption/decryption. Make sure you set
 * the CPU_IS_BIG_ENDIAN flag appropriately.
 * This option does not work unless a UInt32 is exactly 32 bits.

 * and if bit 8 is set then xor the result with 0x169.
 *
 * The MDS coefficients use a multiplication by 1/x,
 * or rather a division by x. This is easy too: first make the
 * value 'even' (i.e. bit 0 is zero) by xorring with 0x169 if necessary,
 * and then shift right one position.
 * Even easier: shift right and xor with 0xb4 if the lsbit was set.
 *
 * The MDS coefficients are 1, EF, and 5B, and we use the fact that
 *   EF = 1 + 1/x + 1/x^2
 *   5B = 1       + 1/x^2
 * in this field. This makes multiplication by EF and 5B relatively easy.
 *
 * This property is no accident, the MDS matrix was designed to allow
 * this implementation technique to be used.
 *
 * We have four MDS tables, each mapping 8 bits to 32 bits.

   * representations are equivalent in some form.)
   *
   * We take 8 consecutive bytes of the key and interpret them as
   * a polynomial k_0 + k_1 y + k_2 y^2 + ... + k_7 y^7 where
   * the k_i bytes are the key bytes and are elements of the finite field.

   *     y^4 + (x + 1/x)y^3 + (x)y^2 + (x + 1/x)y + 1.
   * using straightforward polynomial modulo reduction.
   * The coefficients of the result are the result of the RS
   * matrix multiplication. When we wrote the Twofish specification,
   * the original RS definition used the polynomials,
   * but that requires much more mathematical knowledge.
   * We were already using matrix multiplication in a finite field for
   * the MDS matrix, so I re-wrote the RS operation as a matrix
   * multiplication to reduce the difficulty of understanding it.
   * Some implementors have not picked up on this simpler method of
   * computing the RS operation, even though it is mentioned in the
   * specifications.
   *
   * It is possible to perform these computations faster by using 32-bit
   * word operations, but that is not portable and this is not a speed-
   * critical area.
   *
   * We explained the 1/x computation when we did the MDS matrix.
   *
   * The S vector is stored in K[32..64].
   * The S vector has to be reversed, so we loop cross-wise.
