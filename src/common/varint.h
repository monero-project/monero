/*! \file varint.h
 * \brief provides the implementation of varint's
 * 
 * The representation of varints is rather odd. The first bit of each
 * octet is significant, it represents wheter there is another part
 * waiting to be read. For example 0x8002 would return 0x200, even
 * though 0x02 does not have its msb set. The actual way they are read
 * is as follows: Strip the msb of each byte, then from left to right,
 * read in what remains, placing it in reverse, into the buffer. Thus,
 * the following bit stream: 0xff02 would return 0x027f. 0xff turns
 * into 0x7f, is placed on the beginning of the buffer, then 0x02 is
 * unchanged, since its msb is not set, and placed at the end of the
 * buffer.
