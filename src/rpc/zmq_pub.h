    Clients must ensure that all transaction(s) are notified before any blocks
    they are contained in, and must ensure that each block is notified in chain
    order. An external lock **must** be held by clients during the entire
    txpool check and notification sequence and (a possibly second) lock is held
    during the entire block check and notification sequence. Otherwise, events
    could be sent in a different order than processed. */
