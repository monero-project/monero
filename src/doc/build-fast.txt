Fast rebuilds with cmake (on example of linux, similar is for windows).
All builds (after the 1st build especially) will be faster now:
1. cotire (precompiled headers)
2. modules (build just e.g. the wallet, configurable with command "ccmake .." in build/)


*** SETUP ONCE ***
We recommend to clean all previous builds first.
In project top directory, execute:

mkdir build ; cd build &&  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D BOOST_IGNORE_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -D BUILD_CONN_TOOL=OFF -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -D BUILD_SIMPLE_MINER=OFF -D BUILD_SIMPLE_WALLET=OFF -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D ENABLE_COTIRE=ON -D COTIRE_MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_TARGET_SOURCES=1 -D COTIRE_VERBOSE=ON ..


*** REBUILD ***
Now each time to re-build the project, while in build/ just do:
  make 
or
  make -j 4 

And run ./src/bitmonerod

On windows this is the same, except for other mkdir commnad (just create directory build and run the cmake from inside it!)


*** TESTED ***
